- Objects as real world entities; Has Personalities (Methods) & Properties (Attributes).
- Difference btw methods and functions - No actual difference : functions are called methods in context of an object.
- JS is an unplanned language. (Was developed for DOM purposes only in  the beginning, but the functionalities were extended to make it a full-stack-language.)
- ES6 Classes - Used to define the blueprint or schema for objects.
- Classes are single parent for multiple object with same schema or blueprint.
- **DRY** fundamental in coding - *do NOT repeat yourself*.
- Constructor() - Default and Parameterized
- Constructor function *defines* the properties of a class.
- Everything in JS is an object (e.g. *Prototype Chaining* `arr.__proto__.__proto__` is identified as an object and has its properties equal to an object.)
- `const p1 = new Person("Ishan", "Singh")` copies the prototype of class Person () to p1. ( `Person.prototype` ->  `p1.__proto__`)
- The above is called *Syntactical Sugar*.
- `class B extends A` extends the prototype of class A to class B and now we can use all methods of A inside B.
- Ambiguity Error.
- Arrow functions : `const add = (x,y) => return x+y`;  `arr.map(function(value){ return value * 2 })` -> `arr.map((value) => value * 2)`
