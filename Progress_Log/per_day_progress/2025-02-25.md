- [...arr] -> spread out operator use for shallow copy. e.g. let newArr = negativeIndex([...arr]).
- Sync(Blocking) & Async(Non-Blocking) Codes.
- Callback function.
- Callbacks were used instead of promises in olden days.
- Callback Hell (Callback inside a callback so and so (forming a indentation triangle)).
- Legacy Code (e.g. Callbacks) and Modern Code (e.g. Promises).
- Custom promises.
- Promisification -> converting legacy code to promisified code.
- Async await (Syntactic Sugar) -> helps to run async code in sync way.
